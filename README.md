# styleshift
A web app for neural style transfer

An interesting application of deep learning that takes two images, one for its style and one for its content, and generates a unique image maintaining the content but in a new style. I discovered Neural Style Transfer through Coursera's [Deep Learning Specializaiton](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), where I trained and architected the model in a Jupyter Notebook. I wanted to take this idea and apply it in a web application. Thus, StyleShift was born.
